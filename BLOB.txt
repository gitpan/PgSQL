This is me plan for accessing large objects in PostgreSQL:

Large objects is handled by a specially design IO-class
"IO::BLOB::PgSQL" (or something like that) with methods to:

* open
* close
* read
* write
* seek
* unlink

From SELECT statement such an IO-object could be returned
if an LO is available, create on transparent and nice API.
